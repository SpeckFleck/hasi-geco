{"name":"Hasi-Geco","tagline":"Hard Spheres in Geometric Confinement","body":"### Simulating Hard Spheres in Geometric Confinement\r\n\r\nhasi-geco provides a configuration space for [mocasinns](https://github.com/bkrueger/mocasinns). It helps you to simulate Hard Sphere liquids or serves as a good starting point for developing your own Hard Sphere simulations with [mocasinns](https://github.com/bkrueger/mocasinns).\r\n\r\n### What works?\r\n* 3D Hard Spheres in Confinement\r\n* Available Confinements: spheres, cylinders, plates, nodal approximations of periodic p, d, g and iwp-surfaces - all from inside and outside\r\n\r\n### What's to come?\r\n* Rejection free simulation methods\r\n* Alternative step proposal schemes\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n* [mocatie](http://speckfleck.github.io/mocatie)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Johannes F.
